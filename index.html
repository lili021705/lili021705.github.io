        <p class="lead mb-4">From an early age, teaching has always been a passion of mind and I aim to inspire others to partake in the same field as me.The education system failed me when I was growing up in diagnosing my learning disability. I realized how the education system fails a lot of students including myself at one point. The system doesnâ€™t change or adapt to new generational understanding, they tend to stick with the same educational teachings that can at times seem outdated. For example, growing up in the LA Unified School District I struggled a lot with reading and writing but it wasnâ€™t until the age of 9 that I got diagnosed with a learning disability (dyslexia). But up until that point I wasnâ€™t able to read and write adequately because teachers during that time werenâ€™t specifically trained to spot or notice such disorders. So in turn they would just pass me along from grade to grade so I could be another teacher's problem. This inturn paved the way for me to realize that teachers need ongoing professional development to stay current with educational trends and techniques to better educate students of different generations.If this professional development doesnâ€™t happen, more and more kids like me will slip through the cracks and be deemed as failures , where in reality we just need a different approach to learning. Not every student will be lucky enough like I was to find that one teacher who really listens and takes their time to adhere to the different learning styles of students.
 <br><br>

        Education is my passion because I believe it holds the power to transform lives and unlock potential in ways few other things can. Learning has an unmatched ability to shape perspectives, inspire change, and empower individuals to pursue their dreams. I am drawn to the idea of helping others grow, whether by fostering critical thinking, sparking curiosity, or guiding them toward new skills. Education is a lifelong journey that not only enriches individuals but also uplifts entire communities, creating ripple effects that extend far beyond the classroom. To me, being a part of that journey is both a privilege and a purpose.
<br><br>

        Teachers play a transformative role in students' lives starting as early as elementary school. In these foundational years, teachers are not just introducing academic skills but also shaping students' confidence, curiosity, and sense of self. A caring and attentive teacher can spark a love for learning that lasts a lifetime, creating a safe space where students feel valued, heard, and encouraged to ask questions. These early educators also help children develop essential social and emotional skills, teaching them how to communicate, solve problems, and respect others. Often, elementary teachers recognize and nurture each childâ€™s unique strengths and talents, fostering a belief in their abilities that can positively impact their academic and personal journeys far into the future. Students are constantly learning from their teachers, whether that's academics or just how to be a good person in general. All forms of teaching are essential for child development.
